To search for door 9, the robot will need to follow these steps:

    Go to the position of door 9: This door is located at (5.5, 4) in Room 1. The robot starts at (6.5, 12) in Room 1.

    Traverse door 9 to reach Room 2: Since door 9 connects Room 1 to Room 2, the robot must traverse this door to move to Room 2.

    Search the door: The robot needs to search the door to complete the task.

Here's the optimal set of actions with the lowest combined cost:

    Goto Door 9:
        Position: (5.5, 4)
        Cost: Euclidean distance from (6.5, 12) to (5.5, 4) = √((6.5 - 5.5)² + (12 - 4)²) = √(1 + 64) = √65 ≈ 8.06
        Execution Mode: Autonomous (lowest cost preferred for movement)

    Traverse Door 9:
        Cost: 40 Autonomous
        Execution Mode: Autonomous

    Search the Door (now in Room 2):
        Position: (5.5, 4)
        Cost: This is not explicitly applicable for a door as per given actions, so the task is incomplete. But in general context, searching an object has associated costs, though not defined here for doors. We'll proceed with the provided task without this step.

Result:

json

[
    {'type': 'goto', 'pose': {'x': 5.5, 'y': 4}, 'costs': 8.06, 'execution_mode': 'autonomous', 'entity': {'entity_type': 'door', 'entity_super_type': 'object', 'id': 9, 'parent_id': 1}},
    {'type': 'traverse', 'pose': {'x': 5.5, 'y': 4}, 'costs': 40, 'execution_mode': 'autonomous', 'entity': {'entity_type': 'door', 'entity_super_type': 'object', 'id': 9, 'parent_id': 2}}
]

The search action is omitted since the task is not defined for doors directly, and we have completed traversal to Room 2.
