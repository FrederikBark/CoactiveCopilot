To perform the task of communicating with shelf 4 in room 1, we need to first go to the location of the shelf and then attempt the desired action. However, "communicate" is not a valid action for a shelf; instead, you can only inspect or measure hazards for a shelf.

Here are the steps to reach the shelf 4 and execute an action:

    Move to shelf 4 at (2, 4.5) from the starting position (6.5, 12).
    Inspect the shelf (or measure hazards if requested in future).

Since the lowest cost mode should be chosen, autonomous movement is preferred, and assisted mode will be chosen for inspection due to lower cost compared to teleop and autonomous.

Breakdown:

    Goto action: Moving to shelf 4's position at (2, 4.5) from the robot's starting point at (6.5, 12) in autonomous mode. The Euclidean distance cost is calculated as:
    cost=(6.5−2)2+(12−4.5)2=8.209
    cost=(6.5−2)2+(12−4.5)2

    ​=8.209

    Inspect action: Once at the shelf, the robot inspects it in assisted mode for a cost of 30.

Total combined cost: 8.209+30=38.2098.209+30=38.209.
