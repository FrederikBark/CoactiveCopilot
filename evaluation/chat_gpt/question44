To inspect box 6 without traversing any doors, follow these steps:

    Go to Room 3: Since box 6 is located in Room 3, and we start in Room 1 at position (6.5, 12), we need to traverse to Room 3 via the open connection.
    Go to Box 6: After arriving in Room 3, move to the position of box 6.

Here's the optimal set of actions:

    Go to the open connection between Room 1 and Room 3:
        Position: (9, 6.5)
        Cost: 0 (open connection, autonomous mode preferred)
        Execution Mode: Autonomous
        Entity: Open connection

    Traverse to Room 3:
        Position: (16, 6) (center of Room 3)
        Cost: 0 (open connection, autonomous mode preferred)
        Execution Mode: Autonomous
        Entity: Open connection

    Go to Box 6:
        Position: (12.5, 10.5)
        Cost: Euclidean distance from the center of Room 3 to box 6
        Execution Mode: Autonomous
        Entity: Box 6

Let's calculate the cost of each step:

    Go to the open connection:
        From (6.5, 12) to (9, 6.5)
        Cost: (9−6.5)2+(6.5−12)2(9−6.5)2+(6.5−12)2

​ = 2.52+(−5.5)22.52+(−5.5)2
​ = 6.25+30.256.25+30.25
​ = 36.536.5

    ​ ≈ 6.04

Traverse to Room 3:

    Cost: 0 (open connection)

Go to Box 6:

    From (16, 6) to (12.5, 10.5)
    Cost: (12.5−16)2+(10.5−6)2(12.5−16)2+(10.5−6)2

​ = (−3.5)2+4.52(−3.5)2+4.52
​ = 12.25+20.2512.25+20.25
​ = 32.532.5

        ​ ≈ 5.70

Thus, the optimal set of actions is:
