Hereâ€™s the optimal set of actions for the robot to inspect shelf 4 in Room 1, starting from its initial position at (6.5, 12) in Room 1:
Task: Inspect Shelf 4 in Room 1

    Go to Shelf 4:
        Action Type: goto
        Pose: {'x': 2, 'y': 4.5}
        Costs: 5.4083 (Euclidean distance from (6.5, 12) to (2, 4.5))
        Execution Mode: autonomous
        Entity:

        json

    {
      "entity_type": "shelf",
      "entity_super_type": "object",
      "id": 4,
      "parent_id": 1
    }

Inspect Shelf 4:

    Action Type: inspect
    Pose: {'x': 2, 'y': 4.5}
    Costs: 30
    Execution Mode: assisted
    Entity:

    json

        {
          "entity_type": "shelf",
          "entity_super_type": "object",
          "id": 4,
          "parent_id": 1
        }

Result:

json

[
  {
    "type": "goto",
    "pose": {"x": 2, "y": 4.5},
    "costs": 5.4083,
    "execution_mode": "autonomous",
    "entity": {
      "entity_type": "shelf",
      "entity_super_type": "object",
      "id": 4,
      "parent_id": 1
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "inspect",
    "pose": {"x": 2, "y": 4.5},
    "costs": 30,
    "execution_mode": "assisted",
    "entity": {
      "entity_type": "shelf",
      "entity_super_type": "object",
      "id": 4,
      "parent_id": 1
    }
  }
]

Explanation:

    The robot moves autonomously from its initial position (6.5, 12) to the shelf's position (2, 4.5) in Room 1 with a cost of 5.4083 units.
    Once at the shelf, the robot inspects it using the assisted mode, which is the least costly at 30 units.
