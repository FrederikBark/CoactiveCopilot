Let's break down the tasks:

    Go to Room 2: Room 2 is connected to Room 1 via door 9, located at (5.5, 4). The robot starts in Room 1 at position (6.5, 12). It needs to go to door 9 and then traverse it.

    Go to Room 3: Room 3 is connected to Room 1 via an open connection at (9, 6.5). The robot must first go back to Room 1, then reach the connection, and traverse it.

    Go to Room 4: Room 4 is connected to Room 3 via door 16 at (15.5, 7). The robot will need to go to door 16 and traverse it to reach Room 4.

Action Set
1. Go to Room 2

    Move to door 9:
        The robot's current position is (6.5, 12) in Room 1. The target door is at (5.5, 4).
        Euclidean distance = √[(6.5 - 5.5)² + (12 - 4)²] = √(1² + 64) = √65 ≈ 8.062.
    Traverse door 9: Teleoperated traversal is chosen because it has the lowest cost.

json

[
    {
        "type": "goto",
        "pose": {"x": 5.5, "y": 4},
        "costs": 8.062,
        "execution_mode": "autonomous",
        "entity": {"entity_type": "door", "entity_super_type": "object", "id": 9, "parent_id": 1}
    },
    {
        "type": "traverse",
        "pose": {"x": 5.5, "y": 4},
        "costs": 20,
        "execution_mode": "teleop",
        "entity": {"entity_type": "door", "entity_super_type": "object", "id": 9, "parent_id": 2}
    }
]

2. Go to Room 3

    Move to open connection 0:
        Robot is now in Room 2, and it needs to go back to Room 1 and head towards the open connection at (9, 6.5).
        Euclidean distance from Room 2 center (7, 3) to open connection (9, 6.5) = √[(9 - 7)² + (6.5 - 3)²] = √(4 + 12.25) = √16.25 ≈ 4.0311.
    Traverse open connection 0: Since the traversal cost for the open connection is 0, we prefer autonomous mode.

json

[
    {
        "type": "goto",
        "pose": {"x": 9, "y": 6.5},
        "costs": 4.0311,
        "execution_mode": "autonomous",
        "entity": {"entity_type": "connection", "entity_super_type": "object", "id": 0, "parent_id": 1}
    },
    {
        "type": "traverse",
        "pose": {"x": 9, "y": 6.5},
        "costs": 0,
        "execution_mode": "autonomous",
        "entity": {"entity_type": "connection", "entity_super_type": "object", "id": 0, "parent_id": 3}
    }
]

3. Go to Room 4

    Move to door 16:
        Robot is now in Room 3, and it needs to go to door 16 at (15.5, 7).
        Euclidean distance from Room 3 center (16, 6) to door 16 at (15.5, 7) = √[(16 - 15.5)² + (6 - 7)²] = √(0.25 + 1) = √1.25 ≈ 1.118.
    Traverse door 16: Again, we prefer the teleop mode due to its lowest cost.

json

[
    {
        "type": "goto",
        "pose": {"x": 15.5, "y": 7},
        "costs": 1.118,
        "execution_mode": "autonomous",
        "entity": {"entity_type": "door", "entity_super_type": "object", "id": 16, "parent_id": 3}
    },
    {
        "type": "traverse",
        "pose": {"x": 15.5, "y": 7},
        "costs": 20,
        "execution_mode": "teleop",
        "entity": {"entity_type": "door", "entity_super_type": "object", "id": 16, "parent_id": 4}
    }
]

Here is the optimal set of actions for the entire task:
