To search the shelf in room 4, follow these steps:

    Traverse from Room 1 to Room 4:
        Traverse Door 16: Since the only known way to Room 4 from Room 1 is through Door 16, we need to traverse this door.

    Go to the Shelf in Room 4:
        Go to Shelf 24: After traversing to Room 4, we need to navigate to Shelf 24, which is located at 15.5, 12.5.

    Search the Shelf:
        Search Shelf 24: Finally, perform the search action on Shelf 24.

Here's the optimal set of actions with the associated costs:

    Traverse Door 16
        Type: traverse
        Pose: {'x': 15.5, 'y': 7}
        Costs: 20 (teleop)
        Execution Mode: teleop
        Entity: {'entity_type': 'door', 'entity_super_type': 'object', 'id': 16, 'parent_id': 3}

    Go to Shelf 24
        Type: goto
        Pose: {'x': 15.5, 'y': 12.5}
        Costs: 5.5 (Euclidean distance from Door 16's position at 15.5, 7 to Shelf 24's position at 15.5, 12.5)
        Execution Mode: autonomous
        Entity: {'entity_type': 'shelf', 'entity_super_type': 'object', 'id': 24, 'parent_id': 4}

    Search Shelf 24
        Type: search
        Pose: {'x': 15.5, 'y': 12.5}
        Costs: 60 (assisted)
        Execution Mode: assisted
        Entity: {'entity_type': 'shelf', 'entity_super_type': 'object', 'id': 24, 'parent_id': 4}
