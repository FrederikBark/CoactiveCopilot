To fulfill the task "go to room 2, inspect box 22," the robot must traverse from room 1 to room 4 and inspect container 22 in room 4. Here's the breakdown:
Plan:

    Traverse from Room 1 to Room 2:
        Start in Room 1 (6.5, 12).
        Move to Door 9 at (5.5, 4) to go to Room 2.
        Traverse Door 9 to enter Room 2.
    Inspect container 22 in Room 4:
        Move to the center of Room 4 (15.5, 10.5).
        Move to the container's position at (17.5, 9.5).
        Inspect container 22.

Explanation:

    Goto Door 9: The robot moves to the door (5.5, 4), costing 8.06 units in autonomous mode (the shortest distance from 6.5, 12).
    Traverse Door 9: The robot uses teleoperation (the lowest cost traversal mode) to enter Room 2.
    Goto Container 22: The robot then moves to the container in Room 4, costing 10.61 units.
    Inspect Container 22: It inspects the container in assisted mode (lowest inspection cost).
