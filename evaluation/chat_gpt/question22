To execute the task of going to room 3 and inspecting shelf 17, we will follow the optimal path based on the scenario description.

The robot starts in Room 1 at position (6.5, 12). To get to Room 3, it needs to traverse the open connection at (9, 6.5), as this is cost-free for traversal. After that, the robot will move to inspect shelf 17 in Room 3, which is located at (19, 4.5).

Here is the optimal set of actions:

    Goto the open connection at (9, 6.5) in Room 1 (cost: Euclidean distance from (6.5, 12) to (9, 6.5))
    distance=(9−6.5)2+(6.5−12)2=2.52+(−5.5)2=6.25+30.25=36.5=6.0415
    distance=(9−6.5)2+(6.5−12)2

​=2.52+(−5.5)2
​=6.25+30.25
​=36.5
​=6.0415

Mode: Autonomous (since traversal of open connections has no cost across all modes).

Traverse the open connection to Room 3 (cost: 0 for all modes, choose autonomous).

Goto shelf 17 at (19, 4.5) in Room 3 (cost: Euclidean distance from (9, 6.5) to (19, 4.5)).
distance=(19−9)2+(4.5−6.5)2=102+(−2)2=100+4=104=10.198
distance=(19−9)2+(4.5−6.5)2
​=102+(−2)2
​=100+4
​=104

    ​=10.198

    Mode: Autonomous (as it's preferred for movement).

    Inspect shelf 17 (cost: 35 for autonomous mode).

Here is the complete set of actions:
