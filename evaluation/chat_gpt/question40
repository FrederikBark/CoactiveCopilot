To inspect table 2 teleoperated, we need to perform the following actions:

    Go to table 2: The robot must first move to the location of table 2.
    Inspect table 2: Once at table 2, perform the inspection.

Let's calculate the actions:

    Go to table 2: The position of table 2 is (0.5, 10.5). The robot starts at (6.5, 12). The cost for this action is the Euclidean distance between these two points:
    Distance=(6.5−0.5)2+(12−10.5)2=62+1.52=36+2.25=38.25≈6.18
    Distance=(6.5−0.5)2+(12−10.5)2

​=62+1.52
​=36+2.25
​=38.25

    ​≈6.18

    The action will be performed in autonomous mode (since we need to consider all possible modes, but teleop is specified for inspection).

    Inspect table 2: Inspection of table 2 teleoperated has a cost of 40.

Here's the set of actions with the lowest combined cost:
