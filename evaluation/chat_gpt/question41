To perform the task of searching table 3 in Room 1 with the lowest combined cost, follow these steps:

    Go to Table 3: Since Table 3 is in Room 1 and the robot is already in Room 1, we first need to move to the position of Table 3. The position of Table 3 is (0.5, 8).

    Search Table 3: Once at Table 3, the robot will perform the search action.

Let's calculate the costs and actions:

    Go to Table 3:
        Position of the robot initially: (6.5, 12)
        Position of Table 3: (0.5, 8)
        Euclidean distance to Table 3: (6.5−0.5)2+(12−8)2(6.5−0.5)2+(12−8)2

​ = 62+4262+42
​ = 36+1636+16
​ = 5252

        ​ ≈ 7.2111

    Search Table 3 (Assisted):
        Cost for searching with assisted mode: 60

So the optimal set of actions is:

    }
