To go to Room 3 without using the open connection 0, we'll need to use the door 9 connecting Room 1 and Room 2 and then traverse from Room 2 to Room 3 through the connection between Room 2 and Room 3.

Here’s the set of actions with the lowest combined cost:

    Goto door 9 in Room 1:
        Position: 5.5, 4
        Cost: 8.944 (euclidean distance from 6.5, 12 to 5.5, 4)

    Traverse door 9 to Room 2:
        Cost: 20 (teleop)

    Goto Room 3 from Room 2:
        Position: 16, 6
        Cost: 9.433 (euclidean distance from 7, 3 to 16, 6)

Here’s the complete set of actions:
