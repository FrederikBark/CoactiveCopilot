To complete the task of going to Room 4 and communicating with victim 20, I will determine the optimal set of actions for the robot, starting from Room 1 at position (6.5, 12).

    The robot must traverse from Room 1 to Room 3 using the open connection at (9, 6.5) because there is no traversal cost for open connections and autonomous traversal is preferred.
    Then, it must traverse from Room 3 to Room 4 via Door 16 at (15.5, 7). The traversal will be done autonomously, as autonomous traversal has the lowest cost for doors.
    Once in Room 4, the robot must go to the victim at (14, 9).
    Finally, the robot communicates with victim 21. Communication can only be done in teleop mode.

Summary:

    Go to open connection at (9, 6.5) (Cost: 2.5)
    Traverse the connection to Room 3 (Cost: 0)
    Go to Door 16 at (15.5, 7) (Cost: 6.5)
    Traverse Door 16 to Room 4 (Cost: 40)
    Go to Victim 21 at (14, 9) (Cost: 1.8028)
    Communicate with Victim 21 (Cost: 60)

Total Cost: 110.8028
