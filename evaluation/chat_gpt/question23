The task is to go to room 2 and search table 12. The robot starts in room 1 at the position (6.5, 12).

Here's the optimal set of actions:

    Go to door 9 at (5.5, 4) to traverse to room 2
    The robot needs to move from its current position to the door connecting room 1 and room 2. The Euclidean distance from (6.5, 12) to (5.5, 4) is calculated using the formula:
    d=(6.5−5.5)2+(12−4)2=1+64=65≈8.06
    d=(6.5−5.5)2+(12−4)2

​=1+64
​=65
​≈8.06

    Costs: 8.06 (autonomous)

Traverse door 9 to enter room 2
The robot needs to traverse the door, and it will be done in the assisted mode because it has lower costs than autonomous.

    Costs: 30 (assisted)

Go to table 12 at (9.5, 2) in room 2
Once in room 2, the robot moves to the location of table 12. The Euclidean distance from (5.5, 4) to (9.5, 2) is calculated as:
d=(9.5−5.5)2+(2−4)2=16+4=20≈4.47
d=(9.5−5.5)2+(2−4)2
​=16+4
​=20

    ​≈4.47
        Costs: 4.47 (autonomous)

    Search table 12
    The robot searches table 12. Since searching has the same cost for all tables, it will use the assisted mode because it is the most cost-effective.
        Costs: 60 (assisted)

Total Costs:

The total cost is:
