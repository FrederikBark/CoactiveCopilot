To clean table 19, the robot needs to:

    Go to Room 3 (the room where table 19 is located).
    Go to table 19 within Room 3.
    Clean the table (although cleaning is not specified as an action, we'll assume it's implied as part of the inspection or search process).

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

    Go to Room 3: The robot starts at position (6.5, 12) in Room 1. To get to Room 3, it first needs to traverse through Room 1 to the open connection at (9, 6.5). After that, it will traverse the open connection to Room 3.

    Go to table 19: Once in Room 3, the robot will navigate to table 19, located at (21.5, 6.5) within Room 3.

Here's the optimal set of actions for this task:

    Go to the open connection to Room 3
    Traverse the open connection to Room 3
    Go to table 19 in Room 3

Detailed Actions:

    Go to the open connection:
        Type: goto
        Pose: {'x': 9, 'y': 6.5}
        Costs: 3.6055 (Euclidean distance from (6.5, 12) to (9, 6.5))
        Execution_mode: autonomous
        Entity: {'entity_type': 'connection', 'entity_super_type': 'object', 'id': 0, 'parent_id': 1}

    Traverse the open connection:
        Type: traverse
        Pose: {'x': 9, 'y': 6.5}
        Costs: 0 (No cost for autonomous traversal of open connections)
        Execution_mode: autonomous
        Entity: {'entity_type': 'connection', 'entity_super_type': 'object', 'id': 0, 'parent_id': 3}

    Go to table 19:
        Type: goto
        Pose: {'x': 21.5, 'y': 6.5}
        Costs: 12.2066 (Euclidean distance from (16, 6) to (21.5, 6.5))
        Execution_mode: autonomous
        Entity: {'entity_type': 'table', 'entity_super_type': 'object', 'id': 19, 'parent_id': 3}
