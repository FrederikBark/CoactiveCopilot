To inspect box 5 without using autonomous, assisted, or teleoperated abilities, we first need to find a way to get to box 5. Since box 5 is in room 1, we must consider the costs and paths to get there.

Here are the steps:

    Go to the position of box 5 in room 1: The robot is currently at position (6.5, 12). Box 5 is at position (12.5, 9).
    Inspect box 5: This action is required.

The cost of inspecting box 5 using autonomous, assisted, or teleoperated abilities is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot perform the inspection directly.

Actions:

    Go to box 5:
        Type: goto
        Pose: {'x': 12.5, 'y': 9}
        Cost: (12.5−6.5)2+(9−12)2=62+(−3)2=36+9=45≈6.708(12.5−6.5)2+(9−12)2

​=62+(−3)2
​=36+9
​=45

        ​≈6.708
        Execution mode: autonomous
        Entity: box 5

Since inspecting the box without using any of the allowed abilities is not possible, the only action we can perform is to move to the box's location.

Final result:
