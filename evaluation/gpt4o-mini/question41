search table 3 assisted


To perform the task of searching table 3 in room 1, the robot must first go to the position of table 3, which is located at (0.5, 8). The robot is currently at (6.5, 12) in room 1. 

Here are the optimal actions to fulfill the task:

1. **Go to Table 3**: The robot will move from its current position to the position of table 3.
2. **Search Table 3**: Once at the table, the robot will perform the search action.

Now, let's calculate the costs and create the action set:

1. **Goto Table 3**:
   - Position: (0.5, 8)
   - Cost: Euclidean distance from (6.5, 12) to (0.5, 8) = √((6.5 - 0.5)² + (12 - 8)²) = √(36 + 16) = √52 ≈ 7.2111
   - Execution Mode: Autonomous (preferred mode)
   - Entity: Table 3

2. **Search Table 3**:
   - Cost: 60 (assisted)
   - Execution Mode: Assisted
   - Entity: Table 3

Now, let's compile the actions:

Result:
